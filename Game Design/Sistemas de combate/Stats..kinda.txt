For the sake of this exaple we will pick a class and asign it random numbers at the stats.
For this example we will begin with Paladin

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Paladin Lv. 1
This is a class focused on protect his allies and bring all the attention to him

STATS: (Extracted from "Status Effects" document writen by Cristian)

STR: 50			DEX: 23			INT: 40


HP: The HP is based in the unit Lv, so we will asume that his Max HP is 100

AP: similar to the HP the AP is Lv based. This unit has 50 as max AP

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

DMG calculation
For this example we will take the IMPACT ability of the Paladin.

IMPACT: Delivers an attack with a power of 200

DMG w/o any equipment: (POWER/100) * STR so it would be (200/100) * 50 = 100

DMG with equipment: (POWER/100 + WEAPON DAMAGE) * STR lets say the WPD (Weapon Damage) is equal to 25. So it would be (200/100 + 25) * 50 = 1.350
